## Optimizations
I'd like to optimize the song form submission process by introducing an auto-complete feature. I'd also like to improve the overall performance of the app by integrating a cloud-based database to accommodate a large volume of songs for both the music player and playlist feature.

Lastly, I would like to incorporate a Spotify API, which would enable couples to import their playlists with ease. This would provide a more personalized and enjoyable experience for the users, allowing them to select their favorite songs and create a customized playlist for their special event.

## Lessons Learned

Implemented callback functions on the server to establish a modular and scalable backend infrastructure. This experience enabled me to streamline backend routes by breaking them down into self-contained functions.
